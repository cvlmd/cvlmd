### GradeBook and Registration Application
- **Description:** Together with my team, we designed and developed the GradeBook app to simplify the management of students and their grades. The application allows administrators to add, edit, and delete students with unique email addresses in the database. Key features include holding student registration, resetting status with explanatory messages, notifying administrators before deleting students enrolled in courses, and providing REST APIs for managing assignments. The project also includes a warning system for teachers when attempting to delete assignments with grades.
- **Technologies:** PivotalTracker, GitHub, Visual Studio Code, PostMan, AWS, Slack, EclipseIDE, Spring Boot Java
- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS, JAVA, Python, JavaScript, SQL
- **Team:** This project was built by Coralie Rouveyrol, Louison B√©ranger, and Camila Veille as part of our international semester at CSUMB.
